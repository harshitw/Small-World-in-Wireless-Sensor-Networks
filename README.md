# Small-World-in-Wireless-Sensor-Networks
Small Worlds, if introduced in the wireless sensor networks, can significantly improve the network properties like average path length reduction without much affect in connectivity of the network.
Here, using the concept of directional beamforming by few important selected nodes, this phenomenan of small world in sensor networks is introduced.
